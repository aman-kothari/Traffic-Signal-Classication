Traffic Signal Classification for Automated Vehicles Using LE-NET Architecture


In the modern era of civilization detection of traffic signals for autonomous cars have
become an important factor for compiling with the standards of traffic disciplines which are
imposed by the governments for safer and efficient movements of vehicles. Traffic congestion
and accidents are major issues. One of the chief difficulties in rush hour gridlock control is to
oblige the traffic in a sheltered and productive manner. At the point when traffic request is
extraordinary enough that the collaboration between vehicles eases back the speed of the traffic stream, this outcomes in some clog.


Our proposed model aims to analyze the current traffic situations on the road, dangers and
difficulties near the vehicle, alerting the passengers in case of any threats, and provide a
convenient and healthier navigation containing all the necessary information. The model provides the necessary information to the self-driving car or to the passenger which results in the car taking necessary actions in case of any threats or difficulties. We use the technique of Le-Net to classify all the signs and symbols detected by our sensors.


Our sensors have the ability to detect the images of sizes as low as 32*32 pixels so that
our autonomous vehicle doesn’t miss any signs irrespective of the quality of the image being
used. The Le-Net architecture is an excellent “first architecture” for Convolutional Neural. Like
pretty much every other neural system they are prepared with an adaptation of the explicitly
planned calculations. They can perceive designs with outrageous inconstancy and with heartiness to twists and straightforward geometric changes.
